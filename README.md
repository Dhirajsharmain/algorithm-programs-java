1. Write static functions to return all permutations of a String using iterative method and
   Recursion method. Check if the arrays returned by two string functions are equal.
   

2. Binary Search the Word from Word List
   
   a. Desc ->Read in a list of words from File. Then prompt the user to enter a word to
   search the list. The program reports if the search word is found in the list.
   
   b. I/P -> read in the list words comma separated from a File and then enter the word
   to be searched
   
   c. Logic -> Use Arrays to sort the word list and then do the binary search
   
   d. O/P -> Print the result if the word is found or not
   

3. Insertion Sort
   a. Desc -> Reads in strings and prints them in sorted order using insertion sort.
   
   b. I/P -> read in the list words
   
   c. Logic -> Use Insertion Sort to sort the words in the String array
   
   d. O/P -> Print the Sorted List
   

4. Bubble Sort
   a. Desc -> Reads in integers prints them in sorted order using Bubble Sort
   
   b. I/P -> read in the list ints
   
   c. O/P -> Print the Sorted List
